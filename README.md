# Game Store API

- APIs that perform CRUD operations on entities that are suppose to represent entities of games
- I followed this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhAxLiGC7Pc) and copied this [repository](https://github.com/zangpodawa/GameStore-Backend/tree/main/GameStore.Api), but added a method that select games by genre(s) and shows ordered list of games in descending or ascending order by release date or price.
